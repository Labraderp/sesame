HELLO!

If you are reading this, then you have stumbled upon my first discord bot, Sesame! He is currently very early in his life and does not have any significant features. What he does do is... uh...

	- Limited auto-moderation (slurs and the sort are listed in [path]/resources/blacklist.txt)
		> Deletes messages and logs them
	- Response to his own name (Sesame, capitalized or not)
	- A couple fun bot commands ([path]/commands.py contains descriptions and lists)

He is coded with very poor pythonic etiquette so apologies. I'm using him to learn more Python since I am only
familiar with programming in C and Java. Take care and have fun!

Cheers,

Lab
